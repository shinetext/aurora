  <h3>Tell me more about the Shine Squad</h3>
  <p>We started Shine to empower people to be their best selves at work and in life (and everything in between - we know how it is). We know we all need a little help to get through the day, and we're honored to play a positive role to help you get there.</p>
  <p>As a Shine Squad member you're part of that big picture mission - you'll help spread the love by sharing Shine with friends, connecting with us (the co-founders, heyyyy) for major initiatives, give valuable feedback, and ultimately help spread Shine to as many people as possible to make their day brighter.</p>
