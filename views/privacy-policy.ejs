  <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

  <p>This privacy policy sets out how Shine, Inc. uses and protects any information that you give when you use our website or
    our mobile application (our “App”). Shine Inc. is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. We're all about
    helping you slay the day at work - we're super not into selling our peeps' data.</p>

  <h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
  <p>We collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First and last name</li>
    <li>Phone number</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Birthday</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What do we do with the information we collect?</h3>
  <p>We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following
    reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To personalize your experience (your information helps us to respond to your individual needs)</li>
    <li>To improve our website and product (we continually strive to improve Shine texts and the website based on your feedback)</li>
    <li>We may periodically send promotional emails about new products, special offers or other information which we think you
      may find interesting using the email address which you have provided.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We will also require you to link your ApplePay account with our App if you wish to purchase one of our wellness audio content
    packages. This does not give us access to your credit card or banking information, but is needed so that we can process
    your purchases/subscriptions.</p>

  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure we
    have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we
    collect online.</p>

  <h3>Cookies</h3>
  <p>A cookie is a small file of information placed on your computer. Cookies can help track which websites you visit and what
    you do on the site.</p>
  <p>Shine Text uses cookies for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To understand site analytics to improve site features, tailor content, and enhance user experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Links to other websites</h3>
  <p>Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site,
    you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the
    protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed
    by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in
    question.</p>

  <h3>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h3>
  <p>We will not sell, distribute, or lease your personal information to unrelated third parties unless we have your permission
    or are required by law to do so. We may need to send your personal information to our third-party vendors, who are under
    contractual obligations to keep this information confidential. We may also use your personal information to send you
    promotional information about third parties which we think you may find interesting if you tell us that you wish this
    to happen. Finally, if we ever sell Shine, Inc., or participate in a merger or consolidation, and our User data is one
    of the assets involved in the sale, your personal information will be part of this sale or transfer.</p>

  <p>We may also disclose your personal information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.</li>
    <li>To enforce or apply our
      <a href="/terms-of-service">Terms of Use</a> and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes.</li>
    <li>If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Shine Inc., our customers,
      or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud
      protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
  </ul>
